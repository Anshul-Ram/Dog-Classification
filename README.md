# Dog-Classification
A simple dog breed classifier using tensor flow in a Jupyter notebook.

This machine learning model takes as input a photo and identifies the breed of the dog in the photo.

It was trained with teh Stanford dogs dataset, which includes 20,580 images of dogs of 120 different breeds.

For this project I used transfer learning, where you take a pretrained model and use it as a base for the NN.
