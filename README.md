# Dog-Classification
A simple dog breed classifier using tensor flow in a Jupyter notebook

## Notes on the project as it stands on Github:

* I am new to Github so I have uploaded the original Jupyter Notebook file, the trained neural network(with transfer learning) and a few other files.

* The notebook will not run as the paths for the images and for the neural network are no longer set, it is only meant as evidence (for now).

* The Jupyter notebook is not documented clearly but it still has outputs and shows testing and training.
